# End-to-end NeMo LLM Workflow on DGX Cloud using Airflow

This repository contains the code to build an Airflow DAG that automates all steps necessary to build an end-to-end LLM workflow using NVIDIA NeMo Framework on NVIDIA DGX Cloud.

The Airflow DAG is assembled in `nemo_workflow_dag.py`. To learn how to set-up Airflow and fine-tune a GPT model on the SQuAD dataset, follow along with this [tutorial](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pBgvB8YFRQdVI0B62z3A3ipJAM0IhEK-pbdVspFVnlQ/edit?usp=sharing) .
